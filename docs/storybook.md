## Storybook

Storybook for React Native is configured out-of-the-box in DEV builds only (local device or simulator). You can access it in the Side Menu by clicking on "Storybook".

### Stories

Sample "stories" are available for the generated components. They allow you to preview the components in various states, dependant on the props passed to them.

- [`search-bar.story.js`](https://github.com/ruddell/generator-jhipster-react-native/blob/main/generators/app/templates/app/shared/components/search-bar/search-bar.story.js.ejs)
- [`alert-message.story.js`](https://github.com/ruddell/generator-jhipster-react-native/blob/main/generators/app/templates/app/shared/components/alert-message/alert-message.story.js.ejs)
- [`jhi-form-field.story.js`](https://github.com/ruddell/generator-jhipster-react-native/blob/main/generators/app/templates/app/shared/components/alert-message/alert-message.story.js.ejs)

Use fixtures (JSON files containing sample data) to write stories for your own components.

For more information on Storybook configuration and writing stories, check the [official Storybook documentation](https://storybook.js.org/docs/guides/guide-react-native/).
